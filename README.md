It's an extension that is keeping you sitting straight so you don't have backpain. It's uses AI to remind you in real time. 

When you are slouching the chrome gets blurred so that you are being noticed when to straight up! Ideally, after some time you build a real awareness.

How to use it?
Prerequisites are being in well lit area and not wearing black, oversized hoodies or jumpers etc. 
You simply need to sit straight in front of the computer. Camera should target your both shoulders and head. Also, give some time for an extension to warm-up - it should start working within 10 seconds.

### Main Stack/Technology
* Javascript & Python
* Tensorflow.js, MV3, Tensorflow/Keras incl. Movenet Model
* CUDA


Other: ParcelJS 2.0, conda, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn
### Paper

I can share with you my kind of a scientific work - a paper I created for scientific competition [EUCYS](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/eucys_en) - it's like an engineering dissertation, as one reviewer mentioned. There I lay out all the inner workings of extension part and training part. There I bring up:
* How I collected the data
* How I build and optimized the neural network
* How I implemented interference in web extension
* And many others

## Remove Flash on Load
[Check it on Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-flash-on-load/ngfhipomkoeaonmcaacihmheealokgdk?hl=en-GB&authuser=0)
Removes white flash on load.

After you navigated to the site (clicked on a link or entered site address into searching bar), the site is being loaded and you are often welcomed with a short flash of white light or in general, rapid change of colors. It is annoying and makes your retina hurt. 
This extension is here to protect your eyes.
### Stack:
MV3 & Vanilla Javascript


Under development
